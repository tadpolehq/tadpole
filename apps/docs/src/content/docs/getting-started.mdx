description: How to get Tadpole CLI running on your machine.
---
import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tadpole is a lightweight, DSL and scraper engine. The DSL is powered by KDL. The CLI is the primary way to execute your `.kdl` scripts.

## Why?
Tadpole tries to simplify the complexities of web scraping and automation by:
- **Abstraction**: Simulating realistic human behavior (bezier curves, easing) through high-level composed actions.
- **Zero Config**: Import and share scraper modules directly via Git, bypass NPM/Registry overhead.
- **Reusability**: Actions and evaluators can be composed through slots to create more complex workflows.

## Requirements
- NodeJS
- Modern version of Chrome or Chromimum (Tadpole uses CDP for browser automation)

## Installation

You can install the Tadpole CLI globally using your preferred package manager:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add -g @tadpolehq/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @tadpolehq/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn global add @tadpolehq/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Your First Script
Create a file named `hello.kdl`. We’ll use a simple script to grab the "Article of the Day" from Wikipedia.

```kdl
main {
  new_page {
    goto "https://en.wikipedia.org"
    extract data {
      article {
        $ "#mp-tfa"
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Understanding the Script
- `main`: The execution root of the script.
- `new_page`: Creates a new browser tab and initiates a unique CDP session.
- `goto`: Navigates to a URL. It automatically waits for the `load` event before proceeding.
- `extract`: Transforms page content into a JSON object. By default, it starts at the document level.
- `$`: Scopes the extraction to a specific CSS selector (in this case, `#mp-tfa`).
- `text`: Pulls the `innerText` from the currently selected node and assigns it to the property name (in this case, `article`).

### Running
```bash
tadpole run hello.kdl --auto --headless
```

<Aside type="note">
  The `--auto` flag is used to to specify that Tadpole should try to automatically launch Chrome.
  If your Chrome/Chromimum executable is located at a non standard path, you can provide the
  `--chrome-bin` option with the full path to the binary or start chrome manually with remote debugging
  enabled.

### The Result
```json
{
  "data": {
    "article": "Opifex fuscus is a species of mosquito that is endemic..."
  }
}
```
