## Write Declarative, Modular Scraping Code
Tadpole is built to be composable by allowing you to import modules from local files or remote repositories! All of the complexity
of interacting with the browser is now completely abstracted away by the language! Building scrapers has never been easier!

### Example
```bash
tadpole run redfin.kdl --input '{"text": "Seattle, WA"}' --auto --headless --output output.json
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="redfin.kdl">
    ```kdl
    import "modules/redfin/mod.kdl" repo="github.com/tadpolehq/community"

    main {
      new_page {
        redfin.search text="=text"
        wait_until
        redfin.extract_from_card extract_to="addresses" {
          address {
            redfin.extract_address_from_card
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="output">
    ```json
    {
      "addresses": [
          {
            "address": "2011 E James St, Seattle, WA 98122"
          },
          {
            "address": "8020 17th Ave NW, Seattle, WA 98117"
          },
          {
            "address": "4015 SW Donovan St, Seattle, WA 98136"
          },
          {
            "address": "116 13th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122"
          }
          ...
        ]
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
