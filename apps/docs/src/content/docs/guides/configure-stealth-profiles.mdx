title: Configure Stealth Profiles

Tadpole is designed to also provide features that the ability to appear as a human user.

We are going to write a module to create reusable actions to create believable human profiles.

## Creating Real World Identities
We are going to create several composed actions that represent real world devices. For example,
Apple M2s have a predictable amount of memory, hardware concurrency and viewport size that we should
match to appear "real".

```kdl
module stealth {
  // Apple M2 Pro
  action apply_apple_m2 {
    apply_identity mac
    set_webgl_vendor "Apple Inc." "Apple M2"
    set_device_memory 16
    set_hardware_concurrency 8
    set_viewport 1440 900 deviceScaleFactor=2
  }

  // Windows Desktop
  action apply_windows_16_8 {
    apply_identity windows
    set_webgl_vendor "Google Inc. (Intel)" "ANGLE (Intel, Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620 Direct3D11 vs_5_0 ps_5_0)"
    set_device_memory 16
    set_hardware_concurrency 8
    set_viewport 1920 1080
  }

  // Windows Budget Laptop
  action apply_windows_8_4 {
    apply_identity windows
    set_webgl_vendor "Google Inc. (Intel)" "ANGLE (Intel, Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620 Direct3D11 vs_5_0 ps_5_0)"
    set_device_memory 8
    set_hardware_concurrency 4
    set_viewport 1366 768
  }
}
```

## Using One of the Identities in Practice
Ideally, we want to keep a consistent identity for a single IP address. Constantly switching
can be a red flag. We are going to use the `seed` option from random to ensure if our IP always
uses the same identity. We can also provide `weights` to try to match real world usage. This can
provide a consistent distribution across proxies.

```kdl
module stealth {
  ...

  action apply {
    random weights="20,30,50" seed="=stealthSeed" {
      stealth.apply_apple_m2
      stealth.apply_windows_16_8
      stealth.apply_windows_8_4
    }
  }
}
```

 ## What else?
 The stealth module is brand new in Tadpole. More sophisticated anti bot models will
 require additional measures. This is just the beginning, but it will pass basic
 bot detectors.
